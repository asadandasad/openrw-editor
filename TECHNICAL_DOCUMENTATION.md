## System Architecture

### Architectural Overview

The OpenRW Level and Mission Editor employs a layered architecture that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration between components. The architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern at the highest level, with specialized subsystems handling specific domains such as rendering, file I/O, and user interaction.

The core architecture consists of five primary layers: the Presentation Layer, Application Layer, Domain Layer, Infrastructure Layer, and Platform Layer. Each layer has clearly defined responsibilities and interfaces, enabling independent development and testing while ensuring system cohesion.

The Presentation Layer encompasses all user interface components, including the main window, dockable panels, and specialized editors. This layer is built entirely on Qt5 widgets and follows Qt's signal-slot mechanism for inter-component communication. The design emphasizes responsive user interaction and provides extensive customization options for different workflow preferences.

The Application Layer serves as the orchestration tier, coordinating between user interface events and domain logic. This layer implements the command pattern for undo/redo functionality and manages application state transitions. The layer also handles cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, and user preferences management.

The Domain Layer contains the core business logic of the editor, including the entity-component system, scene management, and mission scripting engine. This layer is framework-agnostic and could theoretically be used with different presentation technologies. The domain models are designed to be serializable and support both binary and text-based persistence formats.

The Infrastructure Layer provides technical services required by the domain layer, including file format parsers, rendering engines, and data access components. This layer abstracts platform-specific implementations and provides consistent interfaces for cross-platform compatibility.

The Platform Layer handles operating system interactions, hardware abstraction, and low-level resource management. This includes OpenGL context management, file system operations, and memory allocation strategies optimized for the editor's usage patterns.

### Component Interaction Patterns

The editor employs several well-established design patterns to manage component interactions and maintain system flexibility. The Observer pattern is extensively used through Qt's signal-slot mechanism, enabling loose coupling between components while maintaining responsive user interfaces.

The Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern forms the foundation of the scene representation, providing flexibility in object composition and efficient processing of large numbers of entities. This pattern is particularly well-suited for game development tools where objects may have diverse and changing sets of properties and behaviors.

The Command pattern implementation enables comprehensive undo/redo functionality across all editor operations. Each user action is encapsulated as a command object that can be executed, undone, and redone. This pattern also facilitates macro recording and batch operations for power users.

The Factory pattern is used extensively for creating different types of nodes in the mission editor, file format parsers, and UI components. This approach enables runtime extensibility and simplifies the addition of new content types without modifying existing code.

The Facade pattern is employed to simplify complex subsystem interactions, particularly in the file format handling and rendering systems. This pattern provides clean, high-level interfaces while hiding the complexity of underlying implementations.

### Data Flow Architecture

The editor's data flow follows a unidirectional pattern that ensures predictable state management and simplifies debugging. User actions trigger events that flow through the application layer to the domain layer, where state changes are applied. These changes then propagate back through the system via the observer pattern, updating all relevant views and components.

Scene data flows from file parsers through validation and transformation stages before being integrated into the active scene graph. The scene graph maintains spatial indexing structures that enable efficient queries for rendering, selection, and collision detection operations.

Mission data follows a similar pattern but includes additional validation steps to ensure logical consistency and runtime compatibility. The visual scripting system maintains both a visual representation for editing and an optimized execution graph for runtime performance.

Rendering data flows through a multi-stage pipeline that includes frustum culling, level-of-detail selection, and batch optimization before submission to the graphics hardware. This pipeline is designed to handle the large-scale environments typical of open-world games while maintaining interactive frame rates.

### Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to scale both in terms of content size and development team size. Content scalability is achieved through lazy loading, spatial partitioning, and level-of-detail systems that ensure memory usage remains bounded regardless of world size.

Development scalability is supported through modular design, comprehensive interfaces, and plugin architecture that enables independent development of different subsystems. The codebase is organized to minimize dependencies between modules and facilitate parallel development efforts.

The plugin system allows for runtime extension of the editor's capabilities without requiring recompilation of the core system. This approach enables community contributions and specialized tools for specific workflows or content types.

Performance scalability is addressed through multi-threading support for I/O operations, background processing of large datasets, and progressive loading of complex scenes. The system is designed to take advantage of modern multi-core processors while maintaining thread safety and avoiding common concurrency pitfalls.


## Core Components

### Entity-Component System Implementation

The Entity-Component System (ECS) forms the architectural backbone of the OpenRW Level Editor, providing a flexible and performant foundation for managing complex game objects and their behaviors. This implementation draws inspiration from modern game engines while being specifically tailored for the requirements of level editing and content creation workflows.

The Entity class serves as a lightweight identifier and container for components, implementing a unique ID system that ensures consistent object references across serialization and runtime operations.

## Mission Editor System

### Visual Scripting Architecture

The Mission Editor System represents the most innovative and complex component of the OpenRW Level Editor, providing a comprehensive visual scripting environment that enables content creators to design sophisticated gameplay scenarios without requiring traditional programming expertise. The system draws inspiration from modern node-based editors such as Unreal Engine's Blueprint system while being specifically tailored for the unique requirements and constraints of GTA-style gameplay mechanics.

The visual scripting architecture is built upon a robust node-graph framework that represents mission logic as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interconnected nodes. Each node encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, ranging from simple mathematical operations to complex gameplay actions such as spawning vehicles or triggering cutscenes. The node-based approach provides several key advantages including visual clarity of logic flow, modular reusability of common patterns, and the ability to validate mission logic at design time rather than runtime.
